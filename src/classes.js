/*Write a class called Point, which represents a point in two-dimensional space. A point has x and y properties, given as arguments to its constructor.

It also has a single method plus, which takes another point and returns the sum of the two points, that is, a new point whose x is the sum of the x properties of the two original points, and whose y is the sum of their y properties.*/

class Point{
	constructor(x, y){
	this.x = x;
  	this.y = y;
	}
  plus(p){
  	this.x + p.x;
    this.y + p.y;
}
 
}
console.log(new Point(1, 2).plus(new Point(2, 1)))
